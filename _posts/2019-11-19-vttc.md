If you want to get started with making Tesla Coils, vacuum tube coils are a pretty good choice. 
Instead of using a spark gap or transistors to switch the circuit, all we need is a vacuum tube of some 
kind to switch (by virtue of coming before the transistor, they're much easier to set up in my opinion).

This particular coil uses 1 811A vacuum tube, which is a power amplifier triode.
