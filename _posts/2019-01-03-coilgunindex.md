<p>Before I go into these builds, I’ll preface by saying I don’t have as much detailed documentation for my high-voltage projects, especially from 9th and 10th grade, but I do have a lot of stories to share- </p>

<p>I’ve been making coilguns for a while. My inspiration for building one was, quite funnily enough, because I read an old Popular Science article discussing launching spacecraft with linear motors. I thought that was crazy but fascinating-how would that work?-and following that curiosity led me to try creating a coilgun-this all spiraled from there. (Railguns would be closer to what the article mentioned, but I had no clue where I’d find proper rails to build one.) I learned about the principles behind this through experimenting-it uses an electromagnet to accelerate a projectile by switching a coil on and off. On-pulsing current through the coil-creates a magnetic field, which pulls the projectile-then, when the projectile nears the coil’s center, off-you switch it, and boom.
