I'm an undergrad studying Astrophysics at UC Berkeley. I'm interested in arts, science, and
engineering, and I hope to apply all three to explore space and discover more about the universe.

I like making things in my free time, check them out by visiting Projects in the corner. I also enjoy painting, rocketry, tabletop RPGs, hiking, and collecting atmospheric optic phenomena and clouds.
