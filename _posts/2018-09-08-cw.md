This circuit takes an AC or pulsed DC input and gives you a higher voltage DC output. This is done by a "ladder"
of capacitors and diodes, as one can see here:

For our build we used 1N4007 diodes and 3kv 10nf ceramic capacitors, both from AliExpress.
You can get 1000 diodes and 100 capacitors for a total of less than $10.
The power supply is a 9v DC supply connected to a CCFL inverter.

First few stages done, ready for testing!
Measuring the voltage with our sketchy homemade high voltage meter, it seems like we are getting 15kv out of this thing:

Time for some spicy videos of the voltage multiplier in action:
