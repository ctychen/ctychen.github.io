Space Enterprise @ Berkeley, aka SEB, is a rocketry team at UC Berkeley that aims to be the first collegiate team to send a liquid bi-propellant rocket past the Karman Line and into space. 

I work on avionics, and here are some of the electronics projects I've done as part of SEB. Although I've 
dabbled with PCB design in the past, my first experiences designing PCBs for big projects and production were here in SEB, and I learned to use Altium Designer and LTSpice over the course of my first semester. 

## Highlights

#### E-1 Board

This has everything you need to control the valves and actuators for our liquid rocket engine, together with a general flight computer that it stacks with.

#### DAQ Board V2

Part of our ground station, this board handles reading sensors that aren't onboard the rocket.

#### Load Cell Amplifier

First thing I ever made with Altium Designer, let's just say that there was a lot of room for improvement.
