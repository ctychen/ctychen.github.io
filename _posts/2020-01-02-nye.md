This was honestly the first time I spent New Year's Eve with such a crowd, but it was quite an incredible experience,
being in Red Square and seeing it all lit up. Thinking back, it's almost surreal this happened in the end of
2019, when we were more oblivious and we didn't yet know what COVID was.

So we were wandering back from having heard a fantastic concert in the State Kremlin Palace (sidenote: got some cool photos inside the Kremlin-the mosaics of the emblems of Soviet republics and organizations were real neat to see, and I will absolutely spam architecture pictures on another post), featuring Strauss,
and it was still a while until midnight, but Manezh Square and the edges of Red Square was crammed. Full-on festivities,
everyone partying, one hell of a light show and concerts and performances and hot snacks and more... It was warm this year, very warm for winter in Russia - given that I spent December in St. Petersburg in 2018 and there was a huge amount
of snow (having lived in the Bay Area for my whole life, snow to me is still absolutely insane) and chilling winds, it was quite wack. In fact,  it had started raining at around 11 PM that night when we were in Red Square, but that didn't
stop people from having a good time. Hey, it was New Year's Eve, on a new decade!

Zhukov and the State Historical Museum fabulously lit up, the sky made the scene even better


Took a long time, but we managed to squeeze our way in. We were super lucky actually-we were on the tail end of this group that was let in. Look at this crowd:

We're in! And yep, the crowd is immense, but there's still space for wandering around, provided you're not in the blob in the middle.

The contrast with the lighting is epic. GUM and the holiday market on one size fully ablaze, while the Kremlin Wall and Lenin's Mausoleum being suitably dark I suppose...always thought that was quite interesting, one side of monuments from the USSR and the other side with an incredibly expensive shopping district...


We heard fireworks would be going off over Spasskaya Tower, so our vantage point ended up being from around here:

Did some digital doodling while waiting, since it was still raining a bit and we had some time until the countdown began:

The Stalinist Gothic skyscraper of Moscow State University, which we had visited earlier in the day.


ANYWAYS, WE'RE GETTING OFF TRACK....FIREWORKS TIME!

After ringing in 2020 there, we headed for Zaryadye Park, which was new to all of us but also pretty epic - great views and great lights, as well as a concert and performances.
