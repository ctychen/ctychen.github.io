Here we have a ZVS (zero voltage switching) driver with a flyback transformer from an old TV.

## Theory ##

The schematic for a ZVS flyback driver:

When power is connected, current starts to flow through both sides of the primary and on to the drains of the transistors. At the same time, the transistors start turning on due to voltage flowing at the gates. Since no two components are the exact same, one will turn on a little faster than the other one and more current can then flow through that. The extra current flowing in that side of the primary robs the gate current from the other and starts to turn it off. A condenser forms an LC tank with the primary and the voltage proceeds to rise and fall sinusoidally. If it were not for that capacitor, the current would continue to increase until the transistors exploded and transformerâ€™s core saturated.

ZVS stands for Zero Voltage Switching. This means that the transistors switch on when there is zero volts across them. This lets them switch when they are carrying the least power. That reduces the losses from switching, which normally would be generating lots of heat - meaning that we don't need to use huge heat sinks even at these levels of power.


We tried using the ZVS-driven flyback transformer in a Jacob's Ladder. As you can see we got some pretty nice arcs:

The high pitched screeching noise they make is a bonus.


We were trying to create a Marx generator with it, so far with 3 stages we have gotten a small arc. Further developments will have to wait, as some of our resistors were burned and will have to be replaced.  Right now it looks like this:
