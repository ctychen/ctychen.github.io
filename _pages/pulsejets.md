In 2023 I spent all of spring break in the metal shop at Davis Hall at Berkeley, welding stainless steel sheets for this giant pulsejet. The eventual goal is to put this beast on a go-kart and drive it around in the Mojave desert, Robert Maddox style.

This pulsejet starts on gaseous propane and then we can run it off of liquid propane, or diesel. Either way, it kicks pretty hard. When testing it we managed to get some slow motion footage from the inlet of the pulsejet, into the combustion chamber, and the dynamics are pretty awesome to see.
