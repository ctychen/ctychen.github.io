# Layperson's Summary


My goal was to develop an improved process to search for habitable small planets (HSPs), rocky planets
similar in size to Earth that might be able to sustain surface-level liquid water. Currently, we know of less
than 60 such planets, and their small size and long orbital periods make them particularly challenging to
detect. However, we really care about finding HSPs because they can tell us about how worlds like Earth
might develop, evolve, and "fit in" in the universe. To search for HSPs, I created a neural network model
designed and trained to identify dips in a star's observed brightness from potential transiting HSPs, as
well as a method for preparing input data that is much more efficient than existing ones. This neural
network model correctly identified known HSPs' transits and, while analyzing star systems in the Kepler
catalog, detected very strong signals, which, upon further examination, could potentially originate from 6
previously-unknown planets. This is big news because if these really are HSPs, a new opportunity to learn
about the development, evolution, and properties of habitable environments opens up, which could help
shed light on Earthâ€™s place in the universe and the possibility of life occurring elsewhere.
