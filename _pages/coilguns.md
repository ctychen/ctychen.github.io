This project is technically 2 separate coilgun projects, maybe even 2.5 depending on how you count. 
In all, the same base was used, but both "coilguns" launch projectiles in somewhat different ways, and thus have quite some differences in the rest of the design.

[The first iteration of this design was a single-stage "classic" coilgun mounted on a cart, and it saw 
several revisions in the trigger mechanism. That project can be found here.](https://ctychen.github.io/coilgun1.html)

[The seccond iteration of this design was adapting it to launch vertically, and we eventually were able to launch projectiles from the ground to over 15 feet in the air. It was incredibly fun to work with, and many dope photos were obtained -- find them (and the writeup) here.](https://ctychen.github.io/launcher.html)
