If you want to get started with making Tesla Coils, vacuum tube coils are a pretty good choice.
Instead of using a spark gap or transistors to switch the circuit, all we need is a vacuum tube of some
kind to switch (by virtue of coming before the transistor, they're much easier to set up in my opinion).
<br/>
The general gist of a Tesla coil circuit isn't that complicated, we're creating a tank circuit with the primary and secondary, and tuning such that we have them resonating. Then we need something to switch the primary tank circuit,
while letting the capacitor bank charge up. The oldest-old-school Tesla coil uses a spark gap for this switch, and we
could also use fancy transistors, but for this particular coil we'll use an 811A vacuum tube, a power amplifier triode which can definitely handle it.
<br/>
Triodes have an anode, a cathode, and a grid, which is this grid (wow) of wire between the anode and cathode. If we change the charges on the grid, we can control the current flow within the vacuum tube, making the tube more conductive when positive voltages are applied, and less conductive when the charge on the grid is more negative.
With this in mind, the circuit for this kind of coil has a bit more than your standard SGTC, which you can see below.
<br/>

The circuit we started with was something like this:

<br/>

After some experimenting, though, some changes were made for our final product.

<br/>
It turned out though that we didn't need to double the output on the MOT, 2000 volts was quite enough for this coil.
The rewound MOT was to supply 6.3 volts for the filament of the vacuum tube, with still enough current.
We added a topload to increase the capacitance on the secondary, and lower the resonant frequency of the secondary circuit. Through some trial and error, we tried an aluminum
cookie tin, a questionable metal plate, foil-covered tape roll, and eventually ended up using this shady disk.

A lot of tuning was done, but eventually? We got this coil running solidly here, and it is really pretty cool.

Now that we had our coil running, it would be even cooler if we could interrupt the output, so we made this
here:

And how the coil is running now...
