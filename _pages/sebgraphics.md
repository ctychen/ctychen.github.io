Aside from engineering work as part of the Avionics team, I also work on artistic and graphics design for 
Space Enterprise at Berkeley, aka SEB. My goal is to create a unique visual style for cool club merchandise,like stickers, posters, and shirts, that will make SEB stand out among technical/engineering groups.
