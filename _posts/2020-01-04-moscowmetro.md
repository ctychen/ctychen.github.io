I've been fascinated by Russian and Soviet history for a really long time, so visiting Moscow in
2019 was absolutely incredible. One of my favorite parts of it all was checking out the very unique metro
network and the cool architecture of the stations...


The stations were designed to not only be transport centers, but also "palaces for the people", and their design
reflects that, at least in the earlier ones. Stations constructed following Khrushchev dropped the
fancy art and decoration and were more spartan, with many following a standard design/layout nicknamed the "centipede".
In the 70s, although this "centipede" layout was still used, designs began to incorporate more artistic features and
unique decorations again, though in different styles.


It's pretty cool checking out all the varying designs and styles, starting with Art Deco, then Soviet Neoclassical,
Socialist Realism, and Stalinist/Stalinist Empire, with the later designs falling more into Modernism, Postmodernism and Neomodernism.
