I write code and mess around with homemade electronics of questionable safety. Nothing new, right?

More specifically this site is a place to document the projects my friend and I work on. 
Besides being a portfolio, we want this site to be a resource and something you can learn from….also as a memorial to all our sadly failed experiments…
