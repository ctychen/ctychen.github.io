For our first big (read: has to be run outside) Tesla coil, we decided to build a rotary spark gap coil. The goal here was to try to make something way more powerful compared to our past experiments (and hopefully get to simulate some interesting atmospheric electrical phenomena even if it is quite nooby) with the restriction of our extremely small budget. 


So, we will be using microwave oven transformers which provide ~2000V at ~1000W and ~0.5A. We'll have 4 of them wired as shown below with a voltage doubler. Filters from microwave ovens were used as a safety measure.

Adding lots of capacitors for filtering, and here is our coil's power supply:

Time to test the supply...

Oops, looks like there was unwanted arcing and some stuff got burnt...

IT WORKS! Getting at least 20000vdc out of this boi here. Even this power supply alone is ridiculously loud.

We also added inductors by connecting some MOT secondaries. These are used as RF chokes.

Next step: spark gap. Our motor is scavenged from some old stuff and screws used for electrodes. Originally we made a motor controller, but it ran erratically so the plan now is to use a variac.

For the primary capacitor, a multi-mini capacitor bank was made using 0.33 uF 800vAC/1200vDC capacitors from Taobao. The capacitance of the bank is 19 nF.

For our primary coil, we will be using 10 AWG solid copper wire.
