<p>So, Tesla coils are cool. In fact, these devices are so cool that they were what actually first inspired me
to begin dabbling in high-voltage electronics back in middle school.</p>

<p>Back then, I started off with a Slayer Exciter circuit. Since then, over the past few years, I've gone on to
explore different kinds of Tesla coil designs, ranging from the classic spark gap circuit to solid-state (and double-
  resonant) circuits, and vacuum-tube-based designs. I'm currently working on a bigger VTTC with a Soviet GU-81 tube,
  getting a musical Tesla coil operational, and hopefully making a QCW coil someday.</p>
