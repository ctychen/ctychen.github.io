								<h2>Searching for Earthlike Worlds</h2>
								<p>Detection of Habitable Small Planet Candidates in Kepler Data with a Deep Neural Network</p>
								<p>Part I / Introduction</p>

								<h3>Summary</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								My goal was to develop an improved process to search for habitable small planets (HSPs),
								rocky planets similar in size to Earth that might be able to sustain surface-level liquid water.
								Currently, we know of less than 60 such planets, and their small size and long orbital
								periods make them particularly challenging to detect. However, we really care about
								finding HSPs because they can tell us about how worlds like Earth might develop, evolve,
								and "fit in" in the universe. To search for HSPs, I created a neural network model designed
								and trained to identify dips in a star's observed brightness from potential transiting HSPs,
								as well as a method for preparing input data that is much more efficient than existing ones.
								This neural network model correctly identified known HSPs' transits and, while analyzing star
								systems in the Kepler catalog, detected very strong signals, which, upon further examination,
								could potentially originate from 6 previously-unknown planets. This is big news because if
								these really are HSPs, a new opportunity to learn about the development, evolution, and
								properties of habitable environments opens up, which could help shed light on Earth’s
								place in the universe and the possibility of life occurring elsewhere.

								<h3>Research Abstract</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
								Habitable small planets (HSPs) are a uniquely interesting population of exoplanets.
								Defined as terrestrial planets roughly of Earth’s size, orbiting in their star’s
								habitable zone, HSPs provide a window to better understanding the development of
								planets in general and Earth-like worlds in particular, as well as helping place
								the solar system within the broader context of the Milky Way, and guiding the
								search for life outside of Earth. Currently, there are fewer than 60 confirmed HSPs,
								making more comprehensive population studies difficult.
								This paper presents a set of new and enhanced methodologies to
								facilitate more efficient discovery of HSP candidates in targets
								from the Kepler catalog. They include a windowed fastfolding method that
								leverages GPU parallel processing to quickly process lightcurve data, an enhanced method
								for simulating HSP transit signals to rapidly generate a large dataset of positive samples
								for neural network training, and a deep neural network (DNN) trained with the population
								of synthetic samples and demonstrated to be able to successfully recover 11 out of
								11 known HSPs with periods in the 100-day to 200-day range with high confidence.
								Focusing on identifying potential small planets orbiting F-, G-, and K-dwarfs with
								periods between 100 and 200 days, these methodologies were then applied to process
								and analyze lightcurve data from 148 Kepler targets, resulting in the discovery of
								6 new HSP candidates. </p>
