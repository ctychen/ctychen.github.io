## GNOME @ Berkeley, Station 1


We have two stations at Berkeley which are participating in a worldwide experiment, GNOME -- the Global Network of Optical Magnetometers to search for Exotic Physics. GNOME attempts to search for axion-like particles, which are a candidate for dark matter. The idea is these very light particles together behave as a field that is present in the universe. This field could form different "domains" where it has different values, so hypothetically, as Earth moves, it may travel through these different domains, an event which we may be able to detect, by observing for signals that could come from the interactions of ordinary matter and the axion domains.
