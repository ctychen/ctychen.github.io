Space Enterprise @ Berkeley, aka SEB, is a rocketry team at UC Berkeley that aims to be the first collegiate team to send a liquid bi-propellant rocket past the Karman Line and into space.

Here are some projects I've worked on as part of SEB avionics. Although I've 
dabbled with PCB design in the past, my first experiences designing PCBs for big projects and production were here in SEB, and I learned to use Altium Designer and LTSpice over the course of my first semester. 

## Highlights

#### E-1 Extension Board (v1, v2, ...)

Everything you need to control valves and actuators for our liquid rocket engine. Stacks with our general flight computer

#### DAQ V2

Part of our ground station, this board handles reading sensors that aren't onboard the rocket.

#### Load Cell Amplifier

First thing I ever made with Altium Designer, let's just say that there was a lot of room for improvement.
