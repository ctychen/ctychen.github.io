# Unit Overview: What does College Board want you to know?

One thing about College Board is that if you know what big ideas and concepts they want you to be super familar with, they'll
tell you. For this particular unit, here's the main takeaway -- if you've learned nothing else, at least understand this:


**Objects with an electric charge will interact with each other by exerting forces on each other.**

**Objects with an electric charge will create an electric field.**


Of course, you probably knew this already, and unfortunately that won't be enough on the test. More specifically, here's what 
you're expected to be able to do on the AP exam in regards to charges and Coulomb's Law:

- Describe the types of charge and the attraction and repulsion of charges.

- Describe the behavior of systems of charged objects interacting with each other.

- Explain and/or describe the behavior of a neutral object in the presence of a charged object or a system of charges.


## What is electric charge?

### Polarization

## Coulomb's Law

### Practice problems
