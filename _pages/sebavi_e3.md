Space Enterprise @ Berkeley, aka SEB, is a rocketry team at UC Berkeley that aims to be the first collegiate team to send a liquid bi-propellant rocket past the Karman Line and into space. Eureka-3 is the project in which we aim to do this, finally, for real. The system will use nitrous oxide and ethane as propellants, with a 3D printed Inconel engine. 

To support the testing and development of this system we have a full new avionics system. I work on the architecture of the avionics system, and building it up and making sure that it can collect all the data we need, and run fully automated testing procedures.
