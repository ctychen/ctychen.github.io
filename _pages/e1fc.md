My biggest project of 2022 has been designing, testing, and integrating the flight computer for Eureka-1, Space Enterprise at Berkeley (SEB)'s liquid bipropellant rocket. Eureka-1, or E-1, is projected to reach an altitude of 30,000 ft, using a pressure-fed system, with liquid propane and LOx as propellants. This is UC Berkeley's first-ever liquid bipropellant rocket and will set collegiate records if successful, and we are aiming to launch in fall 2022.
