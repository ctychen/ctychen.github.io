This project has been going on for a long time and seen many modifications. Right now it is single stage but the plan is to make a multi-stage version soon.

The theory behind this is to use an electromagnet to accelerate a projectile - basically, a linear motor. This is accomplished with a coil of wire, being "switched" on and off. A large current is pulsed through the coil and a strong magnetic field forms, pulling the projectile to the center of the coil. Then, as the projectile nears this point, the coil is switched off so the projectile won't be stuck there. Switching can be done with a spark gap, as in our current design, or with power MOSFETs, IGBTs, or SCRs. We are planning on replacing the spark gap with an SCR soon.


The circuit was inspired by this one on nutsvolts.com. Our circuit uses a ZVS driver and transformer for the capacitor charger. The power source is a 12v lead acid battery.

Earliest version of the coilgun:

2nd version of the coilgun:

Warning system (flashing LED and high pitched beeping noises) added for charging and shooting. Improvements to circuit and design for better results


Beginning with this...

As a trigger/switch, we originally considered using 2 aluminum pieces close together with something separating them in the middle. This would be connected to a string which would be pulled, letting an arc form and closing the circuit - kind of like the mousetrap switches we saw elsewhere. This didn't work out very well. We tried that out here.

Another idea: using a "taser" to trigger:

This is the spark gap trigger we ended up using. Crazy bright and crazy loud when it fires.

We used nails as projectiles. In one test we got a nail shot from a distance of 1 m away stuck in my fence. 

Found that this barrel made of rolled up SAT papers worked pretty well:

One of the  earlier tests, maybe ~1/4 charged:

Not quite fully charged, but still pretty cool.
