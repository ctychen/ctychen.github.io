# Overview

The AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism exam tests for familiarity with the following main areas.

Note that these categories are weighted differently on the AP exam, as you can see below:

- UNIT 1: Electrostatics: 26–34%
- UNIT 2: Capacitors, Conductors, and Dielectrics: 14–17%
- UNIT 3: Electric Circuits: 17–23%
- UNIT 4: Magnetic Fields: 17–23%
- UNIT 5: Electromagnetism: 14–20%

The notes I have here aren't structured by these categories; they're instead organized by subtopics within each category to make it easier to use.

## Test structure

- Multiple Choice: 35 Questions, 45 Minutes, 50% of Exam Score

- Free Response: 3 Questions, 45 Minutes, 50% of Exam Score

Note that 1 of the 3 free-response questions will include an experimental or lab-based component.
If you've taken the AP Physics C: Mechanics test, this one is kinda similar. [You do also get to use the AP Physics C equation sheet, which can be found at this link.](https://secure-media.collegeboard.org/digitalServices/pdf/ap/physics-c-tables-and-equations-list.pdf) It goes without saying that you should have a solid math background.
