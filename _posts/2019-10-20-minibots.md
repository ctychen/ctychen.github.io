Our goal was to create a platform that coders could use to learn 
about programming concepts during off season. 
Not only that, this would also be an option for preliminary code testing
during build season. Our end result is this Raspberry Pi-based minibot, 
which is about 12"*12" and supports the use of WPILib and command based programming.
Minilib, which is WPILib for a Raspberry Pi, 
is currently in progress at https://GitHub.com/HHS-Team670/MustangMinibots
Documentation for assembling and setting up the minibots, 
as well as links to docs for the library, can be found at https://670mustangs.github.io/minibots/
