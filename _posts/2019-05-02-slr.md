After a lot of troubleshooting, we finally have a working version of this switching converter.
It uses a transformer from a microwave, but I can only run it off 50VAC because if I go any higher, 
it arcs over the safety gap (this thing is only designed for 2kV) and it spits steel sparks all over the place.

Here is the supply in action:

The circuit we used is slightly modified from Erik Taylor's, [which can be found on his fantastic website](http://uzzors2k.4hv.org):

Here's what it looks like now:

It took a while to get this up and running. Early on, we used a TV flyback transformer. 
My inverter seems to have killed the flyback. It seemed like I need a better core (and maybe a transformer without a diode) 
because this one seems to be saturating (the circuit pulls 25A at its peak). [It basically looked like this on a scope.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AbFsYL2S1g6T4ocAmJqFsZ2wSnwi78PV/view)


After switching to the microwave transformer, the waveform now looks like [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zD6nBPIWLOPSg2tF4rbqcjFYq1J_4ZUv/view) when shorted. 
[A video of it working can be found here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13xBCghZ-KAYCWRrFQGQr4C6R0ANFRfDI/view)

Lots of big transistors need lots of big heatsinks:

The small steel rod we put on the output has completely melted after a few minutes of running:
