This was my final project for Astro C161 - Relativistic Astrophysics and Cosmology. I was curious about how one might be able to pick up the CMB with as cheap of an antenna and amateur radio setup as possible starting from first principles, and this was my first time really playing around with antenna simulations. In retrospect I made a lot of mistakes, but it was a good experience to learn from in trying to figure out this concept for building an experiment.
