I'm an undergrad studying Physics and Astrophysics at UC Berkeley. I'm interested in arts, science, and
engineering, and I hope to apply all three to explore space and discover more about the universe.

I like making things (electronics, rocketry, robotics, painting + illustration, origami, tabletop gaming maps + minis + worldbuilding).
