After building a coilgun, we thought it would be fun to make a vertical launcher. This required some modification to our original 
coilgun circuit - specifically, the addition of a large SCR used to fire the launcher - and replacing the coil with a flat, 
insulated "pancake" coil of 10 AWG copper wire. The result so far is we can launch nonmagnetic metal objects 
(tested with a 2" by 2" heatsink, and a disk from a discarded hard drive) around 10-14 feet vertically.

It also makes a ridiculous noise when fired.

We have a "control panel" with a switch for charging and a button to fire the launcher. It is a precaution to prevent against firing 
while the capacitors are being charged, and also lets us test the device without fully charging the very large capacitors each time.
There is a meter connected so one can check how much the capacitors have been charged.


We took some inspiration from a similar build by Bob Davis - [he has a nice writeup here](https://sites.google.com/site/bobdavis321/washer-launchers).

The SCR got destroyed during some of our early testing, so it was replaced by 2 small SCRs in parallel.
