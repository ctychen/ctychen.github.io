My biggest board design project so far. A lot of interesting challenges came up throughout the design process, as this board is designed for flight. Because of that, size was a big deal, as well as designing it to work with the flight computer in a stack, and another important consideration was building in safeguards like hardware overcurrent protection. Combine that with the ongoing chip shortage and you have a hell of a project...


To make handling a ton of subcircuits and parts more sensible I used hierarchical design, which was something I've never tried before this, but it turned out quite well.

There's something very aesthetic about seeing this come together, even if routing was quite a nightmare...
