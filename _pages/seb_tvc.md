I worked on the electronics and controls for thrust vector control over Spring 2023, and we static fired it on Octover 7th, 2023.

The project was done for the Collegiate Propulsive Lander Challenge (CPLC); hitting the milestone of TVC-ing a 500+ lbf engine for 10+ s came with a very nice $15,000 and a giant check...which we literally burned through within a few hours of receiving it.
